# Bike_Case_Study

In this hypothetical case study we are tasked with analyzing the data for a fictional bike share company named Cyclistic. The CEO of the company believes that the key to the businesses future success is in maximizing the number of annual subscriptions to the service. Currently there exist single ride, full day, and annual passes. single ride, and full day users are known as casual members while annual pass holders are known as members. Our job is to find out how casual users and members differ in order to develop a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual users into members. We are given access to public data from a real bike share company to complete this simulated business task.
